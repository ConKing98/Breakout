# Breakout

A simple game of Breakout or Brick Breaker written in C++ and OpenGL 3.3 based
on the tutorials provided by [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/).

Compilation requires C++11, GLAD, and GLFW. These may be avaialable through
your OS package manager but can also be downloaded online.

## Status
This project is currently a work in progress. The current development focus is
related to frame-independant collision detection. While such a feature is not
necessary, I find it to be an interesting challenge to tackle.
